### Description

It was originally made for to go with the BeMUD program posted a little while back. I finally got back from school long enough to post this. I made it several months ago but it seems to still be working just fine. Probably one of my better pieces of work as a beginner. =P

I thought about it and realized I should note that I am not the author of BeMUD. I asked the author of BeMUD (back while he was making it) if he wanted my help, he told me to make this.
